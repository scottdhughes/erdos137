# Erdős Problem #137: per-`k` non-powerfulness via the triple tiling (g = 3 instance)

`Erdos137/Finiteness.lean` formalizes the **per-fixed-`k`** conditional result: under the
Granville–Langevin radical lower bound `RadLB k` (a consequence of the abc conjecture, taken
as a hypothesis), for each fixed `k ≥ 3` the product `F k n = n(n+1)⋯(n+k-1)` is powerful for
only finitely many `n`.

This file formalizes the **triple-tiling** route (motivated by Will Sawin's comment at
erdosproblems.com/137). Under the block radical lower bound `BlockRadLB` (the genuine abc input,
applied to the cubic triples), for `k ≥ 3` and `n > k^6` the product `F k n` is **not powerful**
(`not_powerful_of_large`); hence, for each fixed `k`, `F k n` is powerful for only finitely many
`n` (`not_powerful_finite`).

Since the unification into `Erdos137.BlockFramework`, the `g = 3` block objects (`B`, `overlap`,
`W`, `BlockRadLB`) are the **literal `g = 3` instances** of the generic framework, and the public
combinatorial lemmas (`B_eq`, `B_dvd_F`, `rad_triples_le`, `W_dvd_factorial`, `W_le_pow`, …) are thin
wrappers of their generic counterparts (`Bg_eq`, `Bg_dvd_F`, `rad_blocksg_le`, `Wg_dvd_factorial`,
`Wg_le_pow`, …). The headline theorems `not_powerful_of_large`/`not_powerful_finite` retain their
exact statements and run off those wrappers.

## The argument

* Langevin/abc gives, for the squarefree cubic `g(x) = x(x+1)(x+2)`,
  `rad(m(m+1)(m+2)) ≫_ε m^{2-ε}`. Assembled over `⌊k/3⌋` consecutive triples this is
  `∏ rad over triples ≥ (F k n)^{2/3 - ε}` (taken as `BlockRadLB`, the genuine abc input).
* `rad(F k n) = (∏ rad over triples) / W`, where `W = ∏_{p} p^{overlap − 1}` is the over-count
  from primes appearing in more than one triple.
* Each triple is 3 consecutive integers, so the `⌊k/3⌋` triples span `≤ k` consecutive integers.
  A prime `p` divides at most `⌊k/p⌋ + 1` of them, hence `overlap k n p − 1 ≤ ⌊k/p⌋ ≤ v_p(k!)`
  (Legendre's `i = 1` term). Therefore **`W ∣ k!`**, so **`W ≤ k! ≤ k^k`** — proved (generically) in
  `BlockFramework`. On the log scale `log W = ∑_{p<k} ⌊k/p⌋ log p = k log k + O(k)` (the first
  Legendre layer of `k!`, by Mertens' first theorem `∑_{p<k} (log p)/p ∼ log k`), so `W` is
  `(F k n)^{o(1)}` only for `n` super-polynomial in `k`; for `n ≍ k^A` it is `(F k n)^{1/A + o(1)}`,
  and the triple (`g = 3`) route yields the threshold `n > k^6` rather than all `n`.
* `F k n ≥ n^k` (each of the `k` factors is `≥ n`) — proved in `Base` (`pow_le_F`).
* Combine: `(F k n)^{2/3} ≤ rad(F k n) · W`, powerful ⟹ `rad(F k n)^2 ≤ F k n`, and `W ≤ k^k`,
  giving `(F k n)^{1/3} ≤ k^{2k}`. With `F k n ≥ n^k`: `n^{k/3} ≤ k^{2k} = (k^6)^{k/3}`, so
  `n ≤ k^6`. Thus `n > k^6` ⟹ `¬ Powerful (F k n)`.

## What is fully proved (no `sorry`, only Mathlib's three axioms)

* `B_eq`, `B_dvd_F`, `rad_triples_le` — the radical-of-product decomposition wrappers and inequality
  (generic forms `Bg_eq`, `Bg_dvd_F`, `rad_blocksg_le` proved in `BlockFramework`).
* `W_dvd_factorial`, `W_le_pow` — the overlap bound `W ∣ k!` / `W ≤ k^k` (`Wg_dvd_factorial`,
  `Wg_le_pow`).
* `not_powerful_of_large` : `BlockRadLB → 3 ≤ k → k^6 < n → ¬ Powerful (F k n)` — the headline.
* `not_powerful_finite` : `BlockRadLB → 3 ≤ k → {n | 1 ≤ n ∧ Powerful (F k n)}.Finite`.

## The boundary: what is hypothesized

The ONLY hypothesis is `BlockRadLB`: the assembled Langevin/abc radical lower bound
`(F k n)^{2/3} ≤ ∏ rad over triples`. This is the genuine, abc-conditional input (abc itself is
NOT formalized); it is stated in the `ε = 0`, `C = 1` extremal form, which yields exactly the
clean threshold `n > k^6` (the realistic Langevin bound carries an `ε > 0`, giving `n > k^{6+o(1)}`,
the same conclusion). The overlap bound `W ≤ k^k` is proved, not assumed. Because `BlockRadLB` is
a hypothesis (argument), not an `axiom`, `#print axioms not_powerful_of_large` shows ONLY
Mathlib's three axioms (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`), with `BlockRadLB`
discharged as a premise.

## What is left open

The unconditional Erdős #137 remains open, as does abc. The crude `g = 3` triple route gives
`n > k^6` (`not_powerful_of_large`, now an instance of the generic `not_powerful_crude_g` in
`BlockFramework`); the analogous crude `g = 4` block route gives the sharper threshold `n > k^4`
(`not_powerful_of_large_g4` in `Erdos137/QuarticCrude.lean`), which together with Pandey's
unconditional squarefree-value count for `n < k^{5+δ}` would give full joint `(n, k)` finiteness.
That last unconditional input (Pandey) is not formalized here.
