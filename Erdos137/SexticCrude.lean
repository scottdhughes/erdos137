# Erdős Problem #137: the sextic (`g = 6`) crude block route — sharp threshold `n > k^3`

This module instantiates the generic crude (non-smooth) block route `master_ineq_crude_g`
(`BlockFramework`, PART E) at the block length `g = 6`. The crude master inequality reads
`n ^ (6 - 2) ≤ k ^ (2 * 6)`, i.e. `n ^ 4 ≤ k ^ 12`, equivalently `n ≤ k ^ 3`. So under the sextic
block radical hypothesis `BlockRadLB6`, for `k ≥ 6` and `n > k^3` the product `F k n` is **not
powerful** (`not_powerful_of_large_g6`); for each fixed `k ≥ 6`, `F k n` is powerful for only
finitely many `n` (`g6_crude_finiteness`).

## Why `g = 6`

The crude exponent is `2g/(g-2) = 2 + 4/(g-2)`, an integer exactly when `(g-2) ∣ 4`, i.e. precisely
for `g ∈ {3, 4, 6}` — giving `k^6` (`JointFiniteness`), `k^4` (`QuarticCrude`), and `k^3` here. So
`g = 6` is the **last (largest) block length with an integer crude exponent**, and `k^3` is the
**sharpest clean integer-exponent crude threshold this route reaches**: beyond `g = 6` the crude
exponent stays non-integer and only decreases toward `k^2` as `g → ∞` (e.g. `g = 10 → k^{2.5}`). Like
all crude thresholds this is **fully explicit** — no `o(1)`, no unformalized Mertens input — but it
costs a correspondingly higher-degree block radical input: `BlockRadLB6` is the `(F k n)^{5/6} ≤ ∏ rad`
bound over sextic blocks, with the `g`-dependent abc/Langevin constant (the known radical-method
ceiling: a sharper exponent for a worse constant). `k^3` is comfortably below the `k^5` unconditional
squarefree ceiling, so it too is a valid high-`n` input for the squarefree-counting reduction.

## What is proved (no `sorry`, only Mathlib's three axioms)

* `not_powerful_of_large_g6` : `BlockRadLB6 → 6 ≤ k → k^3 < n → ¬ Powerful (F k n)` — the headline.
* `g6_crude_finiteness` : `BlockRadLB6 → 6 ≤ k → {n | 1 ≤ n ∧ Powerful (F k n)}.Finite`.

The ONLY hypothesis is `BlockRadLB6` (the `g = 6` instance of `BlockRadLBg`); it is a premise, not an
`axiom`, so it does not appear in any axiom footprint.
