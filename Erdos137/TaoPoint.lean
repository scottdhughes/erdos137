# Erdős Problem #137: the elementary structure of a "very bad interval"

`Erdos137/Finiteness.lean` and `Erdos137/JointFiniteness.lean` formalize the conditional
finiteness of powerful products `F k n = n(n+1)⋯(n+k-1)` under radical lower bounds. This
file isolates the **elementary, deterministic** structural facts attached to a *very bad
interval* — Terence Tao's name (erdosproblems.com/137) for a block `[n, n+k-1]` whose product
`F k n` is powerful.

The point is entirely valuation-theoretic and uses no radical/abc input:

* Among `k` consecutive integers a prime `p ≥ k` divides **at most one** factor, because two
  factors differ by `< k ≤ p` (`prime_dvd_two_terms_eq`).
* Hence in a very bad block, all of `v_p(F k n)` comes from that single factor `n + i`, and
  powerfulness forces `v_p ≥ 2`, so `p ^ 2 ∣ n + i` (`veryBad_large_prime_sq`).
* In particular a prime `p` that *equals* one of the factors and *exceeds* the block length
  cannot occur in a very bad block: it would have to be a square, which a prime is not
  (`prime_term_gt_length_not_powerful`, `prime_in_block_not_powerful`).

The last statement is exactly the elementary mechanism that pairs with a Baker–Harman–Pintz
type input (a prime in every short interval `[n, n+k-1]`) to rule out very bad blocks: a single
prime that is itself a term of the block and is larger than the block length kills powerfulness.

Tao's analytic density theorem (very bad intervals have density `O(x^{2/5+o(1)})`) is **not**
formalized here; only the deterministic uniqueness/valuation facts above. The two-term linear
relation extraction that is Tao's next step is likewise not formalized.

## Main results (all unconditional — Mathlib's three axioms only)

* `prime_dvd_two_terms_eq` : a prime `p ≥ k` divides at most one of the `k` block factors.
* `veryBad_large_prime_sq` : in a very bad block, a prime `p ≥ k` dividing a factor squares it.
* `prime_term_gt_length_not_powerful` / `prime_in_block_not_powerful` : a prime that is a block
  factor and exceeds the block length prevents powerfulness.

/-- A **very bad interval** (Tao, erdosproblems.com/137): the block `[n, n+k-1]` whose product
`F k n = ∏_{i<k}(n+i)` is *powerful*. For `k ≥ 2` this is exactly a powerful product of `≥ 2`
consecutive integers; the difference of two factors being `< k`, together with the resulting
coprimality of factors away from primes `< k`, is what feeds the Erdős #137 obstruction. -/

/-- **Prime uniqueness in a block.** If a prime `p` is at least the block length `k`, it divides
at most one of the `k` consecutive factors `n, n+1, …, n+k-1`: two distinct factors `n+i`, `n+j`
with `i, j < k` differ by `|i-j| < k ≤ p`, so a common prime divisor would divide a nonzero
number smaller than `p`, which is impossible. -/

/-- **Very bad block + large prime ⟹ the prime squares the unique factor it touches.**
If `F k n` is powerful, `p ≥ k` is prime, and `p ∣ n + i` for some `i < k`, then `p ^ 2 ∣ n + i`.

By `prime_dvd_two_terms_eq` the prime `p` divides *only* the factor `n + i` among the `k` block
factors, so `v_p(F k n) = ∑_{j<k} v_p(n+j) = v_p(n+i)`. Powerfulness gives `p ^ 2 ∣ F k n`, hence
`v_p(F k n) ≥ 2`, so `v_p(n+i) ≥ 2`, i.e. `p ^ 2 ∣ n + i`. -/

/-- **A prime factor exceeding the block length kills powerfulness.**
If `p` is prime, `p > k` (so `p ≥ k`), `i < k`, and the factor `n + i` *equals* `p`, then the
block `[n, n+k-1]` is not very bad: powerfulness would force `p ^ 2 ∣ n + i = p` by
`veryBad_large_prime_sq`, impossible for a prime `p ≥ 2`.

This is the elementary lemma that combines with a Baker–Harman–Pintz prime-in-short-interval
input: a prime `p > k` lying inside `[n, n+k-1]` cannot occur in a very bad interval. -/
