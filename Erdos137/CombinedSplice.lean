# Erdős Problem #137: the combined four-range splice

A single "control panel" unifying the three deterministic non-powerfulness routes proved elsewhere in
the repository, parametric in three range predicates `Mid Sq High : ℕ → ℕ → Prop`. Given a `CoversAll4`
decomposition of every `(k, n)` (with `k ≥ 3`, `1 ≤ n`) into

* the **small** range `n ≤ k`            — discharged unconditionally by Bertrand
  (`upper_half_prime_not_powerful`);
* the **middle/prime** range `Mid`        — a prime `p > k` is a block term (`prime_range_not_powerful`,
  fed by `PrimeInBlockOnRange Mid`);
* the **squarefree-count** range `Sq`     — the squarefree count beats the deterministic capacity
  (`squarefree_range_not_powerful`, fed by `SqfreeCapacityBeatenOnRange Sq`);
* the **high** range `High`               — any externally supplied non-powerfulness input, whose
  predicate carries its own side conditions (e.g. `High k n := 6 ≤ k ∧ k^3 < n` to plug in the crude
  `g = 6` threshold `not_powerful_of_large_g6`, or `5 ≤ k ∧ k^{5/3+η} < n` for the smooth `g = 5`
  bound), so the ambient `3 ≤ k` guard need not match the route's own,

it concludes `¬ Powerful (F k n)` for every such `(k, n)`. The analytic inputs (Baker–Harman–Pintz on
`Mid`, Pandey-type squarefree counts on `Sq`, the abc block bound behind `High`) live ENTIRELY inside
the three premises: Lean never assumes any of them, so nothing here pretends to formalize BHP, Pandey,
Mertens, or abc. This is the four-range analogue of `abstract_splice_no_counterexamples`, with the new
squarefree-count range slotted between the prime range and the high range.

/-- **Four-range coverage.** Every `(k, n)` with `k ≥ 3`, `1 ≤ n` is small (`n ≤ k`), middle (`Mid`),
squarefree-rich (`Sq`), or high (`High`). On the intended instantiation `Mid` is the
Baker–Harman–Pintz prime-gap range, `Sq` is the Pandey squarefree-count range, and `High` is a crude or
smooth radical threshold; coverage is the (external) statement that these four ranges exhaust `n > 0`. -/

/-- **The combined four-range splice.** Parametric in `Mid Sq High`. Given a `CoversAll4` decomposition,
a ranged prime input on `Mid`, a squarefree-capacity input on `Sq`, and a non-powerfulness input on
`High`, the product `F k n` is not powerful for every `k ≥ 3`, `1 ≤ n`. Each case is discharged by the
corresponding deterministic theorem; the analytic content stays in the premises. -/
