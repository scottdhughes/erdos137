# Erdős Problem #137: the quartic (`g = 4`) crude block route — sharp threshold `n > k^4`

This module instantiates the generic crude (non-smooth) block route `master_ineq_crude_g`
(`BlockFramework`, PART E) at the block length `g = 4`. The crude master inequality reads
`n ^ (4 - 2) ≤ k ^ (2 * 4)`, i.e. `n ^ 2 ≤ k ^ 8`, equivalently `n ≤ k ^ 4`. So under the quartic
block radical hypothesis `BlockRadLB4`, for `k ≥ 4` and `n > k^4` the product `F k n` is **not
powerful** (`not_powerful_of_large_g4`); for each fixed `k ≥ 4`, `F k n` is powerful for only
finitely many `n` (`g4_crude_finiteness`).

## Why `g = 4`

The quartic crude route gives the **fully explicit** threshold `n > k^4`, with no `o(1)` and no
unformalized Mertens input. This is the complementary high-`n` input for the usual squarefree-counting
reduction: combined with the low-range prime obstruction and Pandey's unconditional squarefree
short-interval count below `k ^ {5 + δ}`, it is the high-`n` part of the intended joint `(n, k)`
finiteness argument
(Pandey is NOT formalized here). The crude exponent is `2g/(g-2) = 2 + 4/(g-2)`, so `g = 4` is the
**first (minimal) block length for which the crude threshold drops below the `k^5` squarefree
ceiling**, and it gives the clean integer threshold `k^4`. Larger fixed block lengths give still
smaller crude exponents — for example `g = 6` gives `k^3` — but require correspondingly
higher-degree block radical inputs (`g = 5` gives the non-integer `k^{10/3}`).

## What is proved (no `sorry`, only Mathlib's three axioms)

* `not_powerful_of_large_g4` : `BlockRadLB4 → 4 ≤ k → k^4 < n → ¬ Powerful (F k n)` — the headline.
* `g4_crude_finiteness` : `BlockRadLB4 → 4 ≤ k → {n | 1 ≤ n ∧ Powerful (F k n)}.Finite`.

The ONLY hypothesis is `BlockRadLB4` (the `g = 4` instance of `BlockRadLBg`); it is a premise, not an
`axiom`, so it does not appear in any axiom footprint.
