# Erdős Problem #137: the honest `g = 5` per-`k` bound and the abstract splice machine

`Erdos137/JointFiniteness.lean` formalizes the radical-decomposition argument for triples (`g = 3`);
`Erdos137/SmoothRefinement.lean` adds the smooth-part saving. This file develops the corresponding
quintic (`g = 5`) block machinery and separates two logically distinct outputs.

Since the unification into `Erdos137.BlockFramework`, the `g = 5` block objects (`B5`, `overlap5`,
`W5`, `Msplice`) are the **literal `g = 5` instances** of the generic framework, and the public
combinatorial lemmas (`B5_eq`, `B5_dvd_F`, `rad_5blocks_le`, `W5_dvd_factorial`, `W5_le_pow`,
`master_ineq5`, `not_powerful_g5`, `powerful_bound_g5`, `g5_finiteness`) are thin wrappers of their
generic counterparts. The abstract splice machine (`abstract_splice_no_counterexamples` and friends)
is unchanged.

## What is formalized

* **`g5_finiteness` / `powerful_bound_g5` — per-`k` finiteness from one block input.** From the single
  tail-absorbed hypothesis `BlockRadLB5`, for every fixed `k ≥ 5` the set of `n ≥ 1` with `F k n`
  powerful is finite; precisely, every such `n` satisfies `n ≤ Msplice k = (k^{2k})^5 · P k^{10}`. The
  proof is the formalized master inequality `n^{3k} · L k^5 ≤ (k^{2k})^5 · P k^{10}` (`master_ineq5`),
  using the quintic block radical input, the overlap bound `W5 ≤ k^k`, and the smooth-part refinement.
  The guard `5 ≤ k` is essential: for `k < 5` there are no quintic blocks (`⌊k/5⌋ = 0`). This is a
  per-`k` finiteness statement, NOT joint finiteness in `(n, k)`.

* **`abstract_splice_no_counterexamples` — an honest range-splice template.** Parametric in two
  predicates `Mid High : ℕ → ℕ → Prop`. Given (i) `CoversAll Mid High` — every `(k, n)` with `k ≥ 3`,
  `1 ≤ n` lies in `n ≤ k`, `Mid k n`, or `High k n`; (ii) `PrimeInBlockOnRange Mid` — a prime `p > k`
  that is a term of the block on the middle range; (iii) a high-range proof
  `High k n → ¬ Powerful (F k n)`; it proves `¬ Powerful (F k n)` for all such `(k, n)`. The small
  range `n ≤ k` is discharged unconditionally by Bertrand via `upper_half_prime_not_powerful`.

The intended Pandey-free no-gap splice is an ASYMPTOTIC pen-and-paper reading of
`abstract_splice_no_counterexamples`: take `Mid` = the Baker–Harman–Pintz range
`k < n ≤ k^{40/21−o(1)}` (where BHP supplies a prime `p > k` in `[n, n+k-1]`) and `High` = the
Mertens-sharpened quintic range `n > k^{5/3+o(1)}`. Since `5/3 < 40/21`, these ranges overlap for all
sufficiently large `k`, after the usual finite exceptional range (and `k = 3, 4`, handled by the triple
route) is absorbed. Lean does NOT formalize Baker–Harman–Pintz, Mertens, or this asymptotic coverage;
they enter only as the external premises of the abstract splice theorem, and a faithful instantiation
would carry a finite-exception clause.

## What is proved vs. hypothesized

* **Proved (Mathlib's three axioms only):** the `g = 5` block product identities, the radical product
  decomposition, `W5_le_pow` (`W5 ∣ k!`, Legendre), `master_ineq5`, `not_powerful_g5`,
  `powerful_bound_g5`, `g5_finiteness` (all `g = 5` instances of the generic framework), the
  unconditional small-`n` lemma `upper_half_prime_not_powerful` (Bertrand),
  `prime_range_not_powerful`, and `abstract_splice_no_counterexamples`.
* **Hypotheses (analytic inputs, NOT formalized):** `BlockRadLB5` packages the abc/Langevin quintic
  block estimate, its constants, the epsilon loss, and the omitted tail into one explicit normalized
  hypothesis. `PrimeInBlockOnRange`, `CoversAll`, and the high-range proof are premises of the abstract
  splice (encoding BHP + Mertens + the exact exponents on the intended instantiation). All enter as
  premises, so they do NOT appear in the axiom footprint of any theorem. Unconditional Erdős #137 and
  abc remain open.

/-! ## PART B — the small-`n` (Bertrand) input -/

/-- **Small-`n` lemma (unconditional, via Bertrand).** For `2 ≤ k`, `1 ≤ n`, and `n ≤ k`, the
product `F k n` is **not powerful**.

Write `N = n + k - 1` (the top of the block, the largest factor). Applying Mathlib's Bertrand
postulate (`Nat.exists_prime_lt_and_le_two_mul`) at `m = N / 2` (which is `≥ 1` since `N ≥ 2`) yields
a prime `p` with `N / 2 < p ≤ 2 ⌊N/2⌋ ≤ N`. Hence:

* **Upper / single-occurrence:** `2p > 2 ⌊N/2⌋ ≥ N - 1`, so `2p > N - 1`, giving `2p > N` (as
  `2p ≥ N/2·2 + 2 > N`). Thus the only multiple of `p` in `[1, N]` that is itself a block factor is
  `p` (any other multiple is `≥ 2p > N`), and `p^2 ≥ (N/2+1)^2 > N` too.
* **Lower / membership:** `p > N / 2 = (n + k - 1) / 2 ≥ (n + n - 1) / 2 ≥ n - 1` (using `n ≤ k`),
  so `p ≥ n`; and `p ≤ N = n + k - 1`. Hence `p = n + i₀` for some `i₀ < k`: `p` is a **term**.

Then `v_p(F k n) = ∑_{i<k} v_p(n+i) = v_p(p) = 1` (every other factor `< 2p` is not a multiple of
`p`), so `p ∣ F` but `p^2 ∤ F`, contradicting powerfulness. The single occurrence comes from `2p > N`,
not from `p > k`. -/
